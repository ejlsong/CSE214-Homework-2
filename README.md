# CSE214 Data Structures Homework 2

This is the second homework assignment of CSE214: Data Structures at Stony Brook University. This assignment is to simulate how a multi-core CPU works in Java using queues and round-robin scheduling to rotate between processes that need to be worked on. Sub-problems in this assignment include a palindrome checker using a stack, and an implementation of the Levenschtein Distance.
